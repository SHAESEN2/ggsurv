# Calculate and Display Kaplan Meier Curves using ggplot2

## Installation

This version of the package is not on CRAN. It can be installed with

```{r instcran, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
devtools::install_github("sachsmc/ggkm")
```

## Basic usage

```{r}
library(ggkm)
ggplot(lung, aes(time = time, status = status)) + geom_km()
ggplot(lung, aes(time = time, status = status)) + geom_km() + facet_wrap(~ sex)
ggplot(lung, aes(time = time, status = status, color = factor(sex))) + geom_km()
```


## Adding Tick marks

Tick marks are displayed at censoring times that are also not event times

```{r}
ggplot(lung, aes(time = time, status = status)) + geom_km() + geom_kmticks()
ggplot(lung, aes(time = time, status = status)) + geom_km() + geom_kmticks(shape = 1)
``` 

## Different style ribbons
```{r}
ggplot(lung, aes(time = time, status = status, color = factor(sex))) + geom_km() + geom_kmticks()
ggplot(lung, aes(time = time, status = status, fill = factor(sex), color = factor(sex))) + geom_km() + geom_kmticks()

ggplot(lung, aes(time = time, status = status, fill = factor(sex), color = factor(sex))) + 
  geom_km(alpha = .1) + stat_km(geom = "ribbon", alpha = .1, color = "black") + geom_kmticks()
```

## Tranformations

```{r}
ggplot(lung, aes(time = time, status = status)) + geom_km(trans = "cumhaz") + 
  geom_kmticks(trans = "cumhaz") + ylab("Cumulative hazard")
ggplot(lung, aes(time = time, status = status)) + geom_km(trans = "event") + 
  geom_kmticks(trans = "event") + ylab("Cumulative Events (CDF)")

## proportional hazards -> parallel lines on cloglog scale
ggplot(lung, aes(time = time, status = status, color = factor(sex))) + geom_km(trans = "cloglog") + 
  geom_kmticks(trans = "cloglog") + ylab("Complementary Log-Log")

```
